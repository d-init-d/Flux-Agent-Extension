## Active Initiative: CLIProxyAPI First-Class Provider

**Goal:** Add a first-class `cliproxyapi` provider for the extension so users can connect to CLIProxyAPI directly instead of routing through the OpenAI provider setup, while keeping the existing OpenAI-compatible runtime plumbing and security posture.

**MVP Scope:** API-key auth, endpoint-based setup, first-class provider UI, hosted `https://...` support, local loopback `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1` support for CLIProxyAPI only, runtime validation, popup/sidepanel compatibility, test coverage, and docs.

**Execution Rule:** one task at a time -> implement -> verify -> PASS -> commit -> push -> update roadmap -> move next.

| Task | Status | Verify | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CP-01 - Initiative scaffold in roadmap | DONE | Roadmap section reviewed locally | Added execution rule, task table, decision notes, and execution log scaffold for CLIProxyAPI work |
| CP-02 - Shared provider surface | DONE | `pnpm typecheck`; targeted Vitest on provider surface | Added `cliproxyapi` to shared provider types/registry plus endpoint metadata, token window, and rate-limit baselines |
| CP-03 - Loader alignment | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/core/ai-client/__tests__/provider-loader.test.ts src/shared/config/__tests__/surface-consistency.test.ts`; `pnpm typecheck` | `cliproxyapi` is now lazy-loadable and aligned with the runtime provider surface |
| CP-04 - Provider plumbing | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/core/ai-client/__tests__/provider-loader.test.ts`; `pnpm typecheck` | Reused the OpenAI-compatible preset/factory with the documented local default base URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8317`) and `/v1/...` API paths |
| CP-05 - Shared endpoint policy | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/shared/config/__tests__/provider-endpoint-policy.test.ts`; `pnpm typecheck` | Added a shared endpoint policy/normalization module for CLIProxyAPI, Ollama, and HTTPS-only providers |
| CP-06 - Options endpoint validation and quick connect UX | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/options/__tests__/App.test.tsx`; `pnpm typecheck` | Options and runtime mock now reuse the shared policy, normalize `/v1...` inputs, and show provider-specific helper/error copy |
| CP-07 - Background validation and runtime enforcement | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/background/__tests__/credential-vault.test.ts src/background/__tests__/ui-session-runtime.test.ts -t "cliproxyapi"`; `pnpm typecheck` | Background save/validate/runtime paths now enforce the same policy and keep normalized base URLs through credential checks and live session sends |
| CP-08 - Popup, onboarding, and sidepanel alignment | DONE | `pnpm exec vitest run src/popup/__tests__/App.test.tsx src/sidepanel/__tests__/App.test.tsx src/options/__tests__/App.test.tsx src/sidepanel/store/__tests__/sessionStore.test.ts`; `pnpm typecheck` | Popup, onboarding/options, sidepanel, and session defaults now surface real CLIProxyAPI readiness instead of generic OpenAI-biased states |
| CP-09 - Test sweep and security regression coverage | TODO | - | Cover registry, loader, provider, options, runtime, and secret-handling regressions |
| CP-10 - Docs and closeout | TODO | - | Update README/testing guidance and close the roadmap initiative cleanly |

### Execution Notes

- [2026-03-18] CP-01 DONE
  - Roadmap scaffold created for the CLIProxyAPI initiative.
  - Next step: start CP-02 and land the shared provider surface before touching runtime or UI policy.
- [2026-03-18] CP-02 DONE
  - Added `cliproxyapi` as a first-class shared provider with API-key auth, endpoint metadata, default model, and compile-safe token/rate-limit defaults.
  - Next step: start CP-03 to align the lazy loader/runtime registration surface without expanding endpoint policy yet.
- [2026-03-18] CP-03 DONE
  - Added `cliproxyapi` to the lazy provider loader so runtime/provider creation stays aligned with the shared registry surface.
  - Next step: land CP-04 by wiring `cliproxyapi` through the OpenAI-compatible provider preset/factory only.
- [2026-03-18] CP-04 DONE
  - Wired `cliproxyapi` through the OpenAI-compatible preset/factory with the documented local default base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8317` and `/v1/...` API paths.
  - Added minimal loader/provider regression coverage, including a guard against duplicating `/v1` when a hosted endpoint is already versioned.
  - Next step: start CP-05 to centralize endpoint normalization/validation in a shared policy module.
- [2026-03-18] CP-05 DONE
  - Added a shared CLIProxyAPI/Ollama/HTTPS endpoint policy that normalizes `/v1`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `/v1/models` inputs.
  - Next step: land CP-06 by reusing that policy in the Options UX and test runtime mock.
- [2026-03-18] CP-06 DONE
  - Options provider setup now reuses the shared endpoint policy, accepts CLIProxyAPI loopback HTTP, normalizes saved/tested endpoints, and shows provider-specific guidance.
  - Next step: land CP-07 so the background runtime enforces the same endpoint policy instead of trusting the UI alone.
- [2026-03-18] CP-07 DONE
  - Background provider save, credential validation, and live session runtime now enforce the shared endpoint policy and preserve normalized base URLs for CLIProxyAPI.
  - Added targeted runtime coverage to prove `cliproxyapi` session sends switch providers with the normalized `/v1` base URL.
  - Next step: move to CP-08 for popup/onboarding/sidepanel alignment and then CP-09 for a broader regression sweep.
- [2026-03-18] CP-08 DONE
  - Popup, sidepanel, and onboarding/options now distinguish missing endpoint vs saved-but-unvalidated vs ready for `cliproxyapi`, while Codex account-backed guidance stays intact.
  - Session creation defaults now prefer the active provider/model from settings so new sidepanel sessions no longer fall back to OpenAI-biased defaults when CLIProxyAPI is selected.
  - Next step: move to CP-09 for the broader regression/security sweep over provider readiness, runtime gating, and secret-handling edges.

### Decision Notes

- `cliproxyapi` ships as a dedicated provider, not as an alias of `custom` or a hidden OpenAI endpoint override.
- Runtime should reuse the existing OpenAI-compatible provider plumbing wherever possible.
- Local non-HTTPS support is a narrow exception for CLIProxyAPI only and must stay limited to exact loopback hosts.
- Endpoint normalization and validation must converge in a shared policy module so options, background, and tests use the same source of truth.
- `customHeaders` is out of MVP unless required by a real CLIProxyAPI deployment; if enabled later it must be reviewed as a separate security-sensitive task.

> Live execution status: `A-03.1` through `A-03.9` PASS; `A-03.10` remains pending because commit/push requires an explicit user request. `A-05`, `A-07`, `A-08`, `A-09`, and `A-10` are PASS; `A-06` implementation is complete and still tracked against the same known audit baseline (`rollup` via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`). `A-11` is now PASS: `A-11a`, `A-11b`, `A-11c`, and `A-11 QA` are all complete, with gate evidence from commit `1a3ff94` (`pnpm typecheck`, selective Vitest, `pnpm test` at `67 files / 1088 tests`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` on the known `rollup` baseline only). `A-12` is now PASS: `A-12a` through `A-12d` are complete, the sidepanel now exposes extract-table, fill-from-profile, compare-prices, and monitor-page-changes prompt templates without changing background/runtime contracts, and the suite passed `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest (`src/core/ai-client/__tests__/prompts.test.ts` and `src/sidepanel/components/__tests__/InputComposer.test.tsx`), full `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and the same known `rollup` audit baseline only. `A-13` is now PASS: advanced-feature coverage is complete via manager-level and runtime suites, with new assertions for active-session network interception and staged upload isolation/total-size limits, while existing runtime coverage already verifies recording/playback and cross-tab orchestration. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest (`src/background/__tests__/network-interception-manager.test.ts`, `src/background/__tests__/file-upload-manager.test.ts`, and `src/background/__tests__/ui-session-runtime.test.ts` at `3 files / 49 tests`), full `pnpm test` at `67 files / 1103 tests`, `pnpm build`, and the same known `rollup` audit baseline only. `A-14` is now PASS: network interception is restricted to `XHR`/`Fetch` and blocked from auth/credential endpoints, recording exports redact sensitive strings without breaking JSON/script syntax, and persisted workflows redact sensitive action data before storage. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest (`src/background/__tests__/network-interception-manager.test.ts`, `src/shared/storage/__tests__/workflows.test.ts`, `src/background/__tests__/ui-session-runtime.test.ts`, and `src/test/e2e/full-pipeline.test.tsx` at `4 files / 63 tests`), full `pnpm test` at `67 files / 1106 tests`, `pnpm build`, and the same known `rollup` audit baseline only. `P-01a` is now PASS: barrel imports were replaced with direct subpath imports across the targeted runtime, background managers, and options provider wiring to tighten import granularity and tree-shaking hygiene without behavior changes. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest (`src/background/__tests__/ui-session-runtime.test.ts`, `src/background/__tests__/network-interception-manager.test.ts`, `src/background/__tests__/device-emulation-manager.test.ts`, `src/background/__tests__/geolocation-mock-manager.test.ts`, and `src/options/__tests__/App.test.tsx` at `5 files / 88 tests`), full `pnpm test` at `67 files / 1106 tests`, `pnpm build` (2236 modules transformed; `assets/index.ts-DL7ktuPx.js` at 237.42 kB, `assets/index.html-Ow2SK_3Q.js` at 46.23 kB, `assets/openrouter-CA8C8MnQ.js` at 28.17 kB), and the same known `rollup` audit baseline only.

### Sprint 5.1 (Week 19): Hardening

#### `@sub-tech-lead` Tasks

| ID | Task | Est. Hours | Depends On | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| P-01 | Performance optimization | 8h | ALL | < 500KB bundle, < 50MB idle memory |
| P-01a | Bundle analysis + tree shaking | 3h | â€” | Remove unused code |
| P-01b | Lazy load AI providers | 2h | â€” | Only load active provider |
| P-01c | Content script size optimization | 2h | â€” | Minimal CS payload |
| P-01d | Service Worker keep-alive strategy | 1h | â€” | SW doesn't die mid-task |
| P-05a | README.md | 4h | â€” | Installation, usage, features |
| P-05b | CONTRIBUTING.md | 2h | â€” | Dev setup, PR process |

> Live execution status: `P-01a` is PASS via direct subpath imports for runtime/options/background manager dependencies. `P-01b` is PASS: runtime and options provider paths lazy-load only the active provider through `src/core/ai-client/provider-loader.ts`, the injected `aiClientManager` test path remains unchanged, and build output now emits provider-specific chunks (`claude`, `openai`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `openrouter`, plus `provider-loader`). `P-01c` is PASS: `src/content/index.ts` now lazy-loads `DOMInspector`, `AutoWaitEngine`, `ActionStatusOverlay`, and action executors by action family so the eager content-script entry stays minimal, while `src/content/__tests__/manager.test.ts` covers lazy page-context loading and `src/options/__tests__/App.test.tsx` now stubs provider creation to keep the provider validation UI test stable under the new lazy-load path. `P-05a` is PASS: root `README.md` has been reconciled against the repo's current `package.json`, `src/manifest.json`, CI/release workflows, and architecture/testing/security docs so installation, commands, extension surfaces, permissions, and repo documentation references match the actual project state. `P-05b` is PASS: `CONTRIBUTING.md` now documents local setup, verification commands, extension surfaces, CI behavior, release packaging, and PR expectations against the repo's current scripts and workflows. `P-02a` is PASS: `src/test/e2e/p-02a-real-sites.test.tsx` adds deterministic harness-level real-site scenarios for Google, Amazon, and GitHub so search/result, commerce, and repository-tab flows execute through the sidepanel + `UISessionRuntime` path without touching live network dependencies. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest (`src/test/e2e/p-02a-real-sites.test.tsx` at `1 file / 3 tests`), full `pnpm test` at `68 files / 1115 tests`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-02` remains in progress toward the broader `50+` scenario target.

> Update: `P-02b` is PASS via `src/test/e2e/p-02b-spa-sites.test.tsx`, which adds deterministic SPA-oriented E2E coverage for React-style route transitions, Vue-style filter refinement, and Angular-style multi-step wizard flows through the sidepanel + `UISessionRuntime` path. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on `src/test/e2e/p-02b-spa-sites.test.tsx` (`1 file / 3 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`69 files / 1118 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-02` remains in progress pending `P-02d`.

> Update: `P-02c` is PASS via `src/test/e2e/p-02c-edge-cases.test.tsx`, which adds deterministic edge-case E2E coverage for slow page-context fetches, oversized DOM/page-context inputs, and graceful no-op degradation when live page-context collection fails. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on `src/test/e2e/p-02c-edge-cases.test.tsx` (`1 file / 3 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`70 files / 1121 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-02` remains in progress pending `P-02d`.

> Update: `P-02d` is PASS via `src/test/e2e/p-02d-error-recovery.test.tsx`, which adds deterministic error-recovery E2E coverage for recoverable retries that continue the plan, unrecoverable failures that halt the remaining actions cleanly, and optional-action failures that surface safely without crashing the UI/runtime. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on `src/test/e2e/p-02d-error-recovery.test.tsx` (`1 file / 3 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`71 files / 1124 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-02` remains in progress toward the broader `50+` scenario target.

> Update: `P-06` is now in progress via `BETA_PROGRAM.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/beta-feedback.md`, which prepare the beta-program operating kit inside the repo. `P-06b` is PASS with seven structured scripts covering onboarding, provider setup, popup, side panel, recording/playback, export, and workflow reuse. `P-06a` and `P-06c` now have recruitment and triage assets ready, but still require real testers, real browser runs, and actual issue intake before they can be marked complete. Verification for this docs-only slice used `git diff --check` on the new files and tracker updates.

> Update: `P-03a` is PASS via `src/core/command-parser/__tests__/prompt-injection-battery.test.ts`, which now blocks 139 prompt-injection-style attempts and asserts the roadmap target of `100+` blocked attempts directly in the battery. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on `src/core/command-parser/__tests__/prompt-injection-battery.test.ts` (`1 file / 1 test`), full `pnpm test` (`71 files / 1124 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-03` remains in progress pending `P-03b`, `P-03c`, and `P-03d`.

> Update: `P-03b` is PASS via `src/sidepanel/components/__tests__/MessageBubble.xss-matrix.test.tsx`, which adds a deterministic 20-context XSS matrix over the actual `marked -> DOMPurify -> anchor hardening` render path used by assistant markdown. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on the new matrix plus existing markdown/sanitizer suites (`3 files / 136 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`72 files / 1144 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-03` remains in progress pending `P-03c` and `P-03d`.

> Update: `P-03c` is PASS via `src/options/__tests__/provider-key-extraction.test.tsx`, which adds extraction-resistance coverage over save, validate, blocked-save, unexpected-failure, stale-session, and multi-provider transition paths to prove raw provider keys are not recoverable from storage snapshots or surfaced in the options UI. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on `src/options/__tests__/App.test.tsx` plus `src/options/__tests__/provider-key-extraction.test.tsx` (`2 files / 39 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`73 files / 1150 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. `P-03` remains in progress pending `P-03d`.

> Update: `P-03d` is PASS via `src/core/bridge/__tests__/message-protocol-fuzzing.test.ts`, plus small hardening updates in `src/core/bridge/message-validation.ts` and `src/core/bridge/service-worker-bridge.ts` so hostile getter/proxy payloads degrade to invalid-message handling instead of crashing bridge code. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest on the bridge fuzzing + validation suites (`5 files / 100 tests`), full `pnpm test` (`74 files / 1156 tests`), `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, with only the same known `rollup` advisories via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`. With `P-03a` through `P-03d` complete, `P-03` is now PASS with no new critical/high findings observed in the repo-side penetration-test evidence.

> Update: `P-04` is PASS via `PERMISSIONS.md`, `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, `DATA_USE_DISCLOSURE.md`, and `docs/privacy-policy.html`, all aligned to the live manifest and current options/runtime behavior. `P-04a` is PASS because every declared permission and the broad `"<all_urls>"` host scope are explicitly justified against shipped features. `P-04b` and `P-04c` are PASS as repo-side compliance artifacts; the remaining live Chrome Web Store form entry now belongs to `P-08` submission execution rather than the documentation-prep scope of `P-04`.

> Update: `P-07` is PASS via `SECURITY_SIGNOFF.md`, backed by completed `P-03a` through `P-03d` evidence plus the final dependency remediation pass that upgraded vulnerable transitive packages, pinned `esbuild` to `0.27.3`, updated `dompurify`, and removed the stale `@types/dompurify` package. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, which now reports `No known vulnerabilities found`. `P-04b` and `P-04c` remain operational/compliance follow-ups, but they do not block the security sign-off target.

> Update: `P-08a` is PASS via `STORE_LISTING.md`, `STORE_SCREENSHOTS.md`, `BLUEPRINT.md`, and the five committed store assets in `store-assets/`, which now provide final Chrome Web Store title/description copy, caption mapping, and screenshot PNGs for the popup, sidepanel workspace, sidepanel workflows, and options control surface. `P-08b` is PASS via `scripts/package-release.mjs`, `package.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and `.gitignore`, which add a reproducible `pnpm package:release` flow that packages `dist/` into `releases/flux-agent-extension-v0.1.0.zip` locally and reuses the same path in GitHub Releases. Verification passed with `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm package:release` (`releases/flux-agent-extension-v0.1.0.zip`), and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, which now reports `No known vulnerabilities found`. `P-08` remains in progress pending `P-08c` and the actual Chrome Web Store submission/review loop.

> Update: `P-01` remains PARTIAL via `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`. The repo now has a measured baseline for bundle output (`pnpm build`) and packaged release size (`pnpm package:release`), but the current release zip is still above the roadmap's final `< 500KB gzipped` target and the idle-memory target still needs manual browser profiling before `P-01` can be marked PASS.

> Update: `P-02` is now PASS via `src/test/e2e/p-02e-scenario-matrix.test.tsx` and `E2E_SCENARIO_MATRIX.md`, which lift deterministic E2E coverage to 50 documented scenarios across real-site, SPA, edge-case, error-recovery, and matrix-driven flows. Verification passed with `pnpm exec vitest run src/test/e2e/p-02e-scenario-matrix.test.tsx` (`1 file / 24 tests`), `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`.

> Update: `P-08c` is now PARTIAL via `CWS_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md`, which prepares the reviewer-response operating kit inside the repo, including expected evidence, canned answer structure, and escalation rules. The remaining work is external: the actual submission and live back-and-forth with Chrome Web Store reviewers still requires publisher access.

> Update: `P-09` is PASS via `POST_LAUNCH_MONITORING.md`, which defines the post-launch owner rotation, inboxes, crash/error triage expectations, response times, rollback triggers, and daily/weekly monitoring cadence needed after release.

> Update: `P-11` is PASS via `RELEASE_SIGNOFF.md`, which records the final ship gates for lint, typecheck, targeted/new E2E coverage, full test suite, build, release packaging, and high-threshold audit status in a single release checklist artifact.

## Mandatory Development Workflow

> **This section is NORMATIVE.** Every agent session MUST follow this workflow for all phases. See BLUEPRINT.md Â§9 for full details.
> **Enforcement:** This applies EVERY time the user instructs the agent to work. No exceptions.

### Phase-Level Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

When the user gives a command to work on any phase or task group:

1. **READ** BLUEPRINT.md Â§9 and the relevant phase section below
2. **CREATE a detailed TodoList** (`todowrite` tool) â€” atomic, sequential tasks
3. **ASSIGN each task** to exactly ONE sub-agent (`@sub-tech-lead`, `@sub-ui-designer`, `@sub-qa-tester`, `@sub-security-auditor`)
4. **SHOW the todolist** to the user before writing any code
5. **NEVER start coding without a todolist**

> âš ï¸ If the agent starts implementing without creating a todolist first, the session is invalid.

### Per-Task Execution Flow

```
PLAN â†’ DELEGATE â†’ REVIEW â†’ VERIFY â†’ PASS â†’ COMMIT â†’ NEXT
```

1. **PLAN** â€” Mark task `in_progress` in todolist (only ONE at a time). Read relevant files for context.
2. **DELEGATE** â€” Call the `task` tool with the correct `subagent_type` to delegate implementation:
   - `sub-tech-lead` â†’ Core logic, managers, adapters, CDP, schemas, types, prompts
   - `sub-ui-designer` â†’ UI components, styling, frontend pages
   - `sub-qa-tester` â†’ Tests, mocks, coverage, E2E scenarios
   - `sub-security-auditor` â†’ Security audit, classification, vulnerability checks
   - The prompt MUST include: exact files, code patterns, acceptance criteria
   - **Main agent MUST NOT implement directly** â€” only delegate, review, verify
3. **REVIEW** â€” Main agent reads the sub-agent's output. Checks correctness, pattern adherence, no regressions. If rejected â†’ re-delegate with specific feedback (do NOT fix it yourself)
4. **VERIFY** â€” Run ALL verification gates:
   - `pnpm typecheck` â†’ Exit 0
   - `pnpm vitest run <changed-files>` â†’ All pass
   - `pnpm test` â†’ All pass
   - `pnpm build` â†’ Exit 0
   - `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` â†’ No new advisories
5. **PASS** â€” Only if ALL gates pass:
   - Mark task `completed` in todolist **immediately** (never batch)
   - Update DELIVERY_TRACKER.md with `âœ… PASS`
   - Update this roadmap's task status
6. **COMMIT** â€” `git commit` (task files only) + `git push origin main`
7. **NEXT** â€” Proceed to next task in order. **Never skip ahead.**

### TodoList Management Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Create BEFORE work | Todolist must exist before any code is written |
| One `in_progress` at a time | Never have multiple tasks in_progress simultaneously |
| Mark complete IMMEDIATELY | As soon as a task passes, mark it â€” never batch |
| Include sub-agent assignment | Each todo must note which `@sub-*` is responsible |
| Update on scope change | If scope changes, update todolist before proceeding |
| Todolist = source of truth | If it's not in the todolist, it doesn't get done |

### Hard Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Sequential execution | Tasks run in roadmap order, no skipping |
| Evidence required | All 5 gates must pass before marking PASS |
| One commit per task | Never batch multiple tasks in one commit |
| Revert on 3 failures | Stop â†’ revert â†’ document â†’ escalate |
| Sub-agent implements | Main agent only delegates (via `task` tool), reviews, and verifies |
| Never start without todolist | Mandatory for every phase/task group |
| Never bypass delegation | Every task goes through a sub-agent, no exceptions |
